# R_MultiLabel_Csv2Arff
This code is part of my doctoral research.


## Execute

argument 1: string CSV file name with its respective folder path

argument 2: string arff file name with its respective folder path (no problem, the file does not exist! it will be created here)

argument 3: a range of labels that will be converted to nominal

### Terminal
*java -jar R_csv_2_arff.jar "arg1" "arg2" "arg3"*

#### CHECK

There must be a folder called lib with weka.jar inside it. 

Without this folder, the file r_csv_2_arff.jar does not work
